This repository contains the code used to generate the tables and figures for the manuscript published in BMC Womenâ€™s Health (2023) titled "The Carolina Hysterectomy Cohort (CHC): A Novel Case Series of Reproductive-Aged Hysterectomy Patients Across 10 Hospitals in the US South."

The dataset captures detailed clinical and demographic information on hysterectomy patients aged 18 to 44 across 10 hospitals in the US-South between 2014 and 2017, enabling multi-level analysis using electronic medical records.
